# SBB Panel using CSS and inline SVG

##Description
This is the basis code for the SBB Panel element, as described [here](https://permanenttourist.ch/2016/09/html5-and-inline-svg-to-create-the-sbb-cff-ffs-brand-panel/) and as defined in the [SBB CFF FFS Corporate Design Guidelines](http://www.micro.sbb.ch/ci-net/de/home/corporate-design/digital.html). The element should look the same in all projects and in all implementations; from the colour to the text sizes.

This example code can be used on its own, or via a CMS like WordPress or TYPO3.

* CSS should be generated from the Sass file Panel.scss.
* Add the JavaScript from the file Panel.js.
* The figure element contains 7 individual images: one for each appropriate screen resolution break point.
